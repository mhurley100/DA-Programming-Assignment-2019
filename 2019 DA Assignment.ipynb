    "The purpose of the NumPy random package is to generate random numbers as required.  It is highly used in computer programming as the generation of pseudo-random numbers is imperative to many applications for probability distributions and functions in scientific research and other applications.  NumPy generates pseudorandom numbers in the submodule random using the Mersenne Twister algorithm. Pseudorandomness is generation of numbers using a deterministic process.  The numbers appear random but are seeded with an initial number.  These random numbers are used in a range of distributions:\n",
